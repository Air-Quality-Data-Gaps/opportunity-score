# opportunity-score
## Description
This repository contains the code and data for the Opportunity Score generated 
as a part of the EPIC Air Quality Fund. For a detailed analysis and methodology 
behind the Opportunity Score, please see <insert_document_link>. The repository 
is organised as follows:

### Code
There are three codes used towards the Opportunity Score-
  - `data_cleaning.R` is the code to clean the data.
  - `opportunity_score.R` is used to generate the Opportunity Score and extract
     analytical insights from it.
  - `tables_and_figures.R` is used to generate the tables and figures from the 
     score.
     
### Data
The `input` folder contians the inputs to the opportunity score, used in 
`data_cleaning.R` and `opportunity_score.R`. The `output` folder contains 
the output data (opportunity_score.csv and tableB1.csv) and figures. The 
`archive` folder contains the code, inputs and outputs of the 2023 Opportunity 
Score. The corrected 2023 score can be found in 
`archive/2023/data/output/opportunity_score_corrected.csv`

## Running the code
To run the code:
  1. Use R version 4.4.3
  2. Clone this repository

## About the Opportunity Score
The Opportunity Score is designed identify locations with the highest 
possibilities for supporting a single or small, multi-year PM2.5 monitoring 
effort with the best chances to  catalyze national-level impacts. Typically, 
the countries with the highest Opportunity Scores are those with a combination 
of:
  - high PM2.5 levels, 
  - large populations, 
  - high impact of PM2.5 pollution relative to other health risks in the country
  - little or outdated air quality management or policy infrastructure, 
  - few resources flowing into the country targeted at air pollution, and
  - high interest from groups well-poised to conduct long-term air quality 
    monitoring 
  
Although, the calculation prefers places with large populations and high 
pollution levels, if all else is equal, it prioritizes places with a lack of air 
quality infrastructure. This methodology leads to prioritizing places that have 
not traditionally been high on the international air pollution communityâ€™s 
priority list for funding.

Please see <insert_document_link> for a detailed analysis and methodology behind
the Opportunity Score

### How should this score be used - and not used?
The Opportunity Score is  designed to describe where major PM2.5 data 
infrastructure gaps exist, and where it would be most valuable to fill these 
gaps. It can be used for strategic decision-making by philanthropies, 
governments, development agencies, and other actors seeking to tangibly impact 
global air quality data infrastructure. The Opportunity Score is not designed 
to dictate attention or funding strategy for all types of outdoor air quality 
activities.

### Methodology
The current iteration of the Opportunity Score uses 14 country-level indicators
detailed in the following table:

The figure below explains the weighting scheme used for each indicator. 
Following the scheme, the final Opportunity Score can range between 1 and 17. In 
the current iteration, Opportunity Scores of countries range from 5.8 to 16.6 
and are divided into four bands indicating the priority level as follows- 
  - High: Opportunity Score >= 11.8
  - Medium-high: 11.8 > Opportunity Score >= 10.2
  - Medium: 10.2 > Opportunity Score >= 7.8 
  - Low: Opportunity Score < 7.8
